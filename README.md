# UX

As a user, I want to perform the following:

- browse products on the store so I can make an informed decision on what to purchase
- add my selected products to my cart so I can keep browsing and see my projects later
- read about the store's mission statement and purpose
- the ability to pay for my products using Stripe
- to login to my own personal account
- the ability to register for a customer account on the store
- the option to change or reset my password if I need to
